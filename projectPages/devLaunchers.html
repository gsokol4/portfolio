        <p class="info">Dev launchers is a non-profit organization that brings developers and other professionals together to build open source software projects. I worked with the site projects team, which is a team that focuses on front end development of their core website. The team consisted of a product owner, seven developers and one UX designer. The team followed Agile methodologies; we worked in two week sprints with our meeting following the scrum subset of agile methodologies. For our tech stack the styling was done using Sass, and we used NPM for package management, git and github for version control, and React for developing the UI. We built the site projects page, which is the homepage for the team. In particular I worked on building out React.js components and integrating them with the Google calendar api in order to facilitate scheduling and joining meetings.</p>
